# Covid19-Data-Analysis-Using-PowerBI

Data Source Link : https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

After importing the data, I performed few transformations to the data to get the correct analysis from it.

I have plotted a slicer for different countries. There are few cards that shows the total cases, total deaths, new cases, new deaths, total tests and total serious cases.

There is a donut chart that shows Percentage category wise - Total cases, Total tests and total test.

There is a column chart that shows top 5 countries with new cases of covid 19 virus.

Finally, there's a bar chart that shows the total cases, new cases, total deaths and new deaths country wise.
